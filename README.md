# Wikidata Experiments

This repository contains the code necessary to execute the experiments
associated with the paper
*"Querying Wikidata: Comparing SPARQL, Relational and Graph Databases"* by
[Daniel Hern√°ndez](http://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~dhernand/),
[Aidan Hogan](http://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~ahogan/),
[Cristian Riveros](http://web.ing.puc.cl/~criveros/),
Carlos Rojas and Enzo Zerega).

The code on this repository allows to:

* Translate the data to different models used in the experiments.
* Load the data into the respective databases.
* Clean and fix the data.
* Generate parameters for queries that are generated randomly.
* Run the experiments.

The principles and motivations of this code can be found in the paper.
The steeps required to reproduce the experiments are described in
